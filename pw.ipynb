    "Assignment Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Ans. Python developed by the Guido van Rossum .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "Ans. Python supports several types of programming, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It also has support for imperative and declarative styles of programming. This flexibility is one of the reasons why Python is such a popular language among developers. Additionally, Python has a large standard library and a vast community of developers who contribute to various libraries and frameworks, making it easier to develop complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers? \n",
    "Ans. Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "Ans. The correct extension for a Python file is ‘.py.’\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
    "Ans. Python is generally considered an interpreted language. When you write Python code, it is saved in a text file with a extension. This code is then interpreted by the Python interpreter, which reads and executes the instructions in the file line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, there are several types of code blocks used to define the structure of a program. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "Function blocks\n",
    "Conditional blocks\n",
    "Looping blocks\n",
    "Class blocks\n",
    "Exception blocks\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the types of code blocks used in Python. Understanding how to use these blocks effectively is key to writing clean, efficient Python code.\n",
    " \n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python? \n",
    "Ans. In Python, the hash character (#) is used to indicate a single-line comment.\n",
    "\n",
    " 8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Ans. n Python, there are a few functions and modules that can help you determine the version of Python you are currently using. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "sys module: The sys module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter, including sys.version, which returns the version of Python currently in use. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys print(sys.version)\n",
    "import platform print(platform.python_version())\n",
    " \n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?\n",
    "Ans. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called \"lambda\". A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "Ans. “Pip\" stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\". It is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. Pip allows you to easily install, upgrade, and remove packages and their dependencies, making it an essential tool for Python development. Pip is included with Python distributions starting from Python 3.4 and higher, and can also be installed separately for earlier versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python? \n",
    "Ans. Python has many built-in functions that are available for use without the need for any additional import statements. Here are some commonly used built-in functions in Python:\n",
    "print(): Used to print output to the console.\n",
    "input(): Used to accept user input from the console.\n",
    "len(): Used to determine the length of a string, list, tuple, or other iterable.\n",
    "type(): Used to determine the type of an object.\n",
    "range(): Used to generate a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "min(): Used to find the minimum value in a list or iterable.\n",
    "max(): Used to find the maximum value in a list or iterable.\n",
    "sum(): Used to find the sum of all elements in a list or iterable.\n",
    "abs(): Used to return the absolute value of a number.\n",
    "round(): Used to round a number to a specified number of decimal places.\n",
    "sorted(): Used to sort a list or iterable.\n",
    "zip(): Used to combine multiple iterables into a single iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is not specified explicitly. However, Python documentation suggests that identifiers should be reasonably short to improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
    " \n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
    "Ans. Python are the best language than other language because python laboraray better then other Languges.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "Ans. In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the Python interpreter through a process called \"Garbage Collection\". The main idea behind garbage collection is to automatically detect and delete objects that are no longer being used by the program, freeing up the memory they were occupying for reuse\n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "Ans. Here are the steps to install Python on Windows and set path variables:\n",
    "Go to the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.\n",
    "Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard to install Python. Make sure to select the option to add Python to the system path during the installation process.\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, open the command prompt by pressing Win + R and typing cmd in the Run dialog box.\n",
    "In the command prompt, type python --version and press Enter to verify that Python is installed correctly. You should see the version number of Python printed on the screen.\n",
    "If Python is installed correctly, you can now set the path variables. To do this, open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\".\n",
    "Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\". This will open the System Properties dialog box.\n",
    "Click on the \"Environment\n",
